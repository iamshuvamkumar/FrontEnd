opreater are symbol 
type of opreater
airthmatic opreater
is + - * / % ^ ( )
arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/) can be applied with numbers as operand

logical opreater
are used to compare two operands in an expression
: and, or, not
operators. They perform logical operations on boolean values True/False only

bitwase opreater
perform bitwise operation between bits within a number such as AND OR XOR NOT etc..
They operate at the level of individual binary digits rather than decimal places like arithmetic operator does.

relational operator
compares the value of its left-hand side operand with that of right-hand side operand using
a relational operator like < > <= >= ==!=

assignment operator
assigns a new value to variable(left hand) based upon the result obtained from evaluating the rig
ht-hand side expression(right hand). The assignment is done by placing the equal sign 
between them. Example : x = y+z assigns sum of z and y into variable 'x

increment & decrement operator
used for incrementing or decreasing the value stored inside variables without assigning it back
to same memory location
++var increments var's current value by one then returns updated value after each use
--var decrements var's current value by one then returns updated value after each use

compound statements
group multiple statements together under single name so they execute sequentially
example if else statement which contains both conditional execution block alongside code blocks
for loop also known as iteration control structure executes set of instructions repeatedly until certain condition is met
for loop
while loop
do while loop
switch case
try catch finally
